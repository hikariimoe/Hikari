features remaining:
* getting the last few messages in the channel for remembering and preserving previous contexts
* searching google images 
* find a way to optimize prompts
* properly viewing and visiting websites (currently implemented improperly) (should use sth like cheerio to purge any and all script tags)
* giving it access to a stable diffusion model to generate images
* safety measures for sfw environments
* supporting /aicg/ proxies that have keys to them (such as my own)
* (unlikely) support using multiple proxies at once to circumvent ratelimits (this feels unethical ngl)
*
