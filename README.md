## Overview

This is a project centered around the creation and proposition of a Discord bot codenamed Hikari, which aims to be made as an insanely elaborate and comprehensive attempt at creating an anime-esque AI chatbot that can support just about any use case beyond what most chatbots ar capable of doing.

Just think, wouldn't it be cool if you could use a chatbot as a detailed assistant that is capable of doing anything you want it to in a reasonable capacity? That's what this project aims to do.

And besides, wouldn't you like to have such a unique friend?

### Features
* Semi-proper and in-progress access to the expanses of the internet;
* Very long-term memory management that can be used to store and retrieve information;
* Elaborate access and jurisdiction to capably moderate a server, or an environment;
* Comprehensive detail on what it's doing, and what it's thinking;
* The ability to search for images, videos, and other media;

## Contributions

If you would like to contribute to the project, **please** inform a developer via. an issue that describes what you're working on or trying to implement; or ask to be assigned a task from one of the open issues! You can also do this over our discord server. You also need to know how to reasonably work on a bot.

### Requirements

* Node.js v18
* PostgreSQL v12
* Any form of access to GPT-3.5, or GPT-4 (Use GPT-4 for the best possible results.)

### Support

All development should be resolved and curated over our [issue tracker](https://github.com/irisu01/Hikari/issues), but all bot support questions should be made over our [discord](https://discord.gg/ZbXUfT82ed).
